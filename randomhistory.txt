-------Random Test Gardens Card-------

I tested gardens, this was a fairly easy card to test and so the biggest thing that I changed were
the parameters that I passed into card effect. I pass it random assigned values for choice, bonuspoint and handpos and then
checked if the return value was equal to -1. 

After executing the program it outputed that the test ran correctly.

-------Random Test Adventure Card-------

I got a compiler error with an undefined reference to some functions that were used from dominion.c
Those were erased by #including "dominion_helpers.c"

I also got errors with cardEffect, in randomtestadventure they only passed 5 variables when cardEffect expects 7. 

So I added a variable bonus and inserted a random value for handpos

Also, it segfaulted if I just ran the code. I believe this is because players is recieving a random number between 0 and 4.

If it recieved a 0 at any time it segfaulted and i was able to fix this by making it generate a random number between 1 and 4.
