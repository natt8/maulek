The 5 card functions I refractored was 
	1. adventure
	2. council_room
	3. feast
	4. mine
	5. smithy


I figured out which variables were called without being initialized
within the switch statement and then called them within the parameters
of those functions.

I created the prototype of the five functions at the top of dominion.c
so and the definitions of those functions are defined just before the end
of the dominion code.

Prototypes of the functions: 
	int Adventure(int, struct *gameState, int *, int, int *);

	int Council_Room(struct *gameState, int *, int);

	int Feast(struct *gameState, int *, int *, int);

	int Mine(struct *gameState, int, int, int *, int);

	int Smithy(int *, struct *gameState, int);
